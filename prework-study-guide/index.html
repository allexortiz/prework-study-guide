<ul>
  <li>git status: checks what branch we are currently on</li>
  <li>git checkout -b branch-name: creates a new branch and switches to it</li>
  <li>git revert [version]: reverts to the version you input</li>
  <li>git clone [paste copied SSH value]: clones a repository that you want</li>
  <li>git checkout -b [feature/starter-code]: a new branch, "feature/starter-code", is created and the working branch is changed to the new branch. The git command must precede every Git statement. The checkout command is to move the working branch to a new branch. The -b flag creates a new branch. The feature/starter-code is the name of the new branch. We have added the prefix, feature, to indicate that it is a feature. It is good practice to name the branches for the feature that will be developed by them to help indicate the purpose of each branch.</li>
  <li>git add -A: The add command adds modifications in the current working branch to the staging area. The -A flag indicates that we want to add all changes. The staging area informs Git that the changes will be added in the next commit.</li>
  <li>git commit -m "add starter code": a commit was created that captures a snapshot of the currently staged changes. Once committed, feature/starter-code will be updated with the starter code.</li>
  <li>git pull origin main: we identify a Git command with the git keyword. Then use the pull command to receive a branch's modifications into the local environment. The origin keyword indicates the source of the pull will be in the GitHub repo. The main keyword indicates the branch. In our case, we are receiving a branch called main from the GitHub repository.</li>
  <li>git push origin feature/starter-code: we are using a new command push to push the changes we have locally to our remote GitHub branch. When using the push command, you can create a new remote branch or add new changes to an existing branch.</li>
