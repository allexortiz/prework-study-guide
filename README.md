# Prework Study Guide Webpage

## Description

My motivation for creating this was to learn how to use and understand HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript. I built this to try my best to help other newcomers learn the basics of coding. I believe this solves the issue of understanding these topics. I learned that you have to carefully read what you are doing and input your actions correctly because it is very easy to mess up.
